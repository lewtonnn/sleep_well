      '<img src="intro-image-1.jpg.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Do you remember your childhood days when life was not tough and everything was so easy including sleep? The best example of sleeping from those days is when kids used to come back for school and sleep for good 2-3 hours in the afternoon before they used to get out for some outdoor games and activities. The best thing was people used to get down in their beds around 9 or 10 at night because in those days there was not much to do except for reading, watching television or just basic internet surfing.</p><p>Today, we are blessed, or in right words cursed with every kind of technology. We have mobile phones, laptops, game consoles and whatnot. Even our outdoor activities have reduced largely. This has resulted in people not getting enough tired and staying awake until after midnight. People who work tirelessly have also become so involved in the worldly gains that they do not get enough sleep and their brain has become so used to constantly working that it does not accept sleep anymore. Diseases like cancer, obesity, and various heart problems have increased in recent times because sleeping habits have distorted a lot in these past few years. It is not foolish to say that we have become human robots and are consistently harming ourselves.</p><p>This book is for all those people who are aiming to make a difference for themselves, for their health and also for their future generations. A good sleep is vital and it is as important as drinking the adequate amounts of water or eating the right type of food. People take their sleep for granted but they are not aware of how evil this ignorance is. It can cause various health issues, both physical and mental, which can even lead to fatal diseases.</p><p>This book is a perfect start to a good and better lifestyle. It has everything that an individual needs for a better sleep - a sleep that can change their lives for good.</p><p>Effective Guide on how to sleep well every day is written for everyone. It is for the people with bad sleeping habits and also for those who sleep perfectly but are always ready to improve their sleep tendency. There are a few categories of people, however, that will benefit the most from this guide. They are:</p><ul><li>Elderly people: This book will be a great help for people with age above 60. As people get older their sleep patterns and habits change a lot. The change usually results in less quality sleep. They are also most likely to face various sleeping disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disorders (which we will discuss in the next part in detail).</li><li>Workaholics/People who work hard: Workaholics are quite crazy about their work life, and sometimes they have no time for their health. They also tend to suffer from various sleep disorders because of little or no sleep at all. Businessmen who work day and night suffer from insomnia and other dangerous disorders that usually lead to cancer and heart problems.</li><li>Night Shifter: People with nigh jobs follow quite a different sleep cycle. It is a well-known fact that a night sleep is far better than a morning sleep. This book will be a great guide for all the night shifters, as it will guide them in various ways and ideas as to how they can get a good sleep in the morning hours.</li><li>Teenagers: Teenagers do not have a fixed time to sleep because their sleeping hours depend on their assignments, their part-time jobs, and their social commitments. They are faced with peer pressure and pressure from society in many ways. All these things lead to sleep deprivation in them. This guide is a perfect way to find out all the things that can relax their minds and help them sleep better.</li><li>Students: Life of a student is a challenge especially those who are in universities because mostly they are away from their homes and have to do everything themselves, while simultaneously making sure that their grades are okay, and they have to do all this without their parents’ help. They hardly get enough sleep because assignments and exams rarely end. This guide will help them to find perfect hours to sleep and how through simple things such as correct light and sound they can create an impact on their sleeping patterns.</li><li>People suffering from depression: Depression is one of the most deadly diseases of all times. It can lead to insomnia and other sleep disorders that may cause death. The various sleeping methods explained in this book in the later parts will help fight back depression and will also guide on how people with various mental health issues can improve their sleep patterns.</li><li>Mothers who are breastfeeding: This will be discussed in detail in the last few parts. It is essential to include this group of people here because mothers who nurse go through a tough day and night duty every day and infants give them a hard time. This book understands how nursing mothers lack sleep, which also usually leads to postpartum depression. Their job is hardly appreciated and this guide will be one way to appreciate their efforts by helping them to find out ways to sleep better.</li><li>People who travel a lot: People who travel a lot usually include business persons, artists, singers and also those people who have jobs in cities where they don’t live in. Their sleeping hours are usually spent on airplanes, trains, and buses. This guide will provide different ways and small techniques that can help the people of this category to get a sleep as good as they would have got while being on their beds.</li>/ul><p>The categories are endless and we can go on and on. In short, this book is for everyone since sleep is important for every single individual. You will find how small changes such as a perfect mattress or a correct light can help create a difference. There is also a chapter dedicated to various diets that an individual can include in his/her life that can make them sleep better and soundly.</p><p>Before you start reading this book, it is important that first you analyze yourself. What kind of a sleeper are you? Do you sleep late at night and wake up late or are you the one who wakes up quite a few times during your sleep? There are also those people who don’t sleep at all or sleep at alternative nights. Do you belong to such a group? It is very crucial to choose the right category for yourself because a right category can help to produce better results.</p><p>The book will start by giving you a brief introduction to sleep habits and sleep patterns. It will also guide you through the disadvantages of sleep deficiency and how it can contribute negatively to your lifestyle. In the later parts of this book, you will learn about various ways you can improve your sleep habits and also how people with different kind of jobs can improve their sleep patterns.</p><p>In the coming parts, there is a lot to learn and adapt so gear up for a journey that is build to only benefit you.</p>',

    name: "Why is Sleep Important?",
    text:
      '<img src="images/inbook/part-1-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Sleep is defined as a state of body and mind, which occurs for hours in which the nervous system is found to be inactive, the eyes are closed and the muscles get a chance to relax. The consciousness is also found to be suspended. Sleep is a great opportunity for the body’s functions to take a break and relax for a while. It plays a key role in good health and the well-being of an individual throughout his/her life.</p><p>A good and enough sleep can lead to better mental and physical health, which results in a good lifestyle. During sleep, an individual’s body gets a chance to work on the brain development and the maintenance of the physical health. In teenagers and children, a sound sleep of a few hours contributes positively towards their growth and overall development. Good night’s sleep improves learning. It also helps to make an individual creative.</p><p>Sleep is involved in healing a person’s blood vessels. Sleep deprivation can lead to various heart problems, obesity, and even cancer. Obesity in teenagers is quite common due to sleep deficiency and it is said that with each hour sleep lost, the chances of getting obese go up. A good sleep also makes sure that your insulin level is normal thus avoiding the risk of having diabetes.</p><p>People who do not sleep well are less productive at work or at school depending on which age group they belong. They take longer to finish work, take longer to understand things and tend to make more mistakes than those who sleep well. Sleep deficiency can also cause microsleep. Microsleep is a term used for short duration sleep that occurs while one is awake. Microsleep cannot be controlled and sometimes individuals are unaware of any such kind of sleep they had.</p><p>Some people are unaware of the harms sleep deprivation can cause. Even with little sleep, they expect themselves to work like perfectionists, though it gets really hard to concentrate in case of little or no sleep. Drivers usually drive in spite of sleep deficiency and experts say that driving while being sleep deprived is equal to drunk driving. Drivers’ sleepiness plays a great role in road accidents every year. Sleep deprivation is found in people from other lines of work as well such as mechanics, assembly line workers, pilots, lawyers, and students.</p><p>When an individual sleeps, his/her immune system produces protective substances like cytokines. These substances are used to fight against harmful bacteria and viruses. Cytokines also help the body and mind to sleep thus giving the immune system more energy to protect the body and fight against any illness or disease. Sleep deprivation or deficiency causes problems for the immune system in building its army. If a person doesn’t get enough sleep, his/her body might not be able to fight against harmful invaders. It also takes longer to recover from any type of illness.</p><p>There is an evidence available that proves that how sleep deficiency can cause different types of cancer. People with circadian rhythm disorders are at a higher risk of suffering from cancer. It was found, through a study, that women who had worked shifts had a 30 percent rate brighter chance of having breast cancer as opposed to women who did not have work shifts. Shift work is also seen to cause prostate cancer in men. The disruption in circadian rhythm can cause various cancers because the disturbance in the body’s clock affects the functions of the body in many ways. The suppression of melatonin at night can also be the reason behind this.</p><p>Adults with good memories but disrupted circadian rhythms can have a buildup of a substance called amyloid plaque. This substance can serve as an early symptom of Alzheimer. Bipolar Disorder is also one of the most dangerous diseases of all time. Sleep deprivation can trigger manic episodes for some people who suffer from bipolar disorder.</p><p>A lack of sleep can also contribute to premature aging. Women, especially, who suffer from a lack of sleep show various signs of premature aging and their skin’s ability to fight back sunlight also decreases with time.</p>',

          '<p>Sleep is quite similar to food and water. Its deficiency can lead to severe damage on both the physical and mental health of a human being. Insufficient sleep can also lead to social problems in human beings. The health consequences that the deprivation of sleep can lead to must be taken seriously. In recent years, the U.S Center for Disease Control and Prevention has declared sleep as a public health epidemic. Other countries must also follow the same direction and should treat the increasing lack of sleep as a health problem that needs to be resolved immediately.</p><p>In today’s rapidly growing societies, people are sleeping less and less as compared to olden times. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. There are many factors, both individual and social, that contribute to the amount of sleep people have. These include age, circadian traits, alcohol, drugs, medical conditions, work life, family and social obligations.</p><p>The data below shows how much sleep people of various age groups require.</p><table border="1"><tr><th>Age group</th><th>Hours of sleep</th></tr><tr><td>Newborns (0-3months)</td><td>14-17hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Infants (4-11 months)</td><td>12-15hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Toddlers (1-2 years)</td><td>11-14hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Preschoolers (3-5 years)</td><td>10-13hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>School-age children (6-13 years)</td><td>9-11hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Teenagers (14-17 years)</td><td>8-10hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Younger adults (18-25 years)</td><td>7-9 hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Adults (26-64 years)</td><td>7-9 hrs each day</td></tr><tr><td>Older Adults (65+)</td><td>7-8hrs each day</td></tr></table><p>The stats above can vary according to the health of individual and also other social conditions.</p><p>The stats above are hardly attainable by the people of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Most of the people sleep for less than 7 hours a day and there are also some people who get a good night’s sleep once or twice a month.</p><p>One of the reasons why today’s sleep differ from the sleep decades ago is that now we have an artificial light everywhere which means many people face the problem of a reduced sleep. This is because of the way the circadian clock works. The timer system of our body has evolved over time and it values the amount of light the body needs, quite differently than before.</p><p>In today’s world, where time and money is everything and people are chasing money as if it is the only thing that can bring them happiness, sleep or rest hours are given the least priority. The focus on work and a decrease in leisure time has brought an increased time squeeze.</p><p>The fast growth in smartphone and media that is digital has removed the line that separated work life with personal life. These two aspects have merged and it is one of the biggest and unfortunate reasons behind the deteriorating health conditions of people all around the world. There is a large fall in free time now and the increased pace of life has brought with it various negative things such as stress and sleep deficiency.</p>'

        name: "What Causes Sleep Deprivation?",
        text:
          '<p>Sleep deprivation and insomnia are both related to the lack of sleep. They are actually two different things and should also be treated differently. We will discuss both separately.</p><p>Sleep Deprivation can be caused by various factors that can be environmental, medical, habitual and psychological. In some cases, instead of one factor contributing to the lack of sleep, there are multi-factors that lead to this condition.</p><p>Some of the most common causes of sleep deprivation are described below.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Voluntarily Not Accepting Sleep</h3><p>Some people choose not to sleep because they are unaware of the number of hours of sleep their body needs. This voluntary pattern of restricted sleep leads to behaviorally induced insufficiently sleep syndrome. Instead of sleeping, the individuals prefer wasting time on socializing or enjoying their hobbies, thus restricting sleep. There are also people who consume alcohol and drugs before their bedtime, which again affects their sleep.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Commitments Related To Work or Study</h3><p>Various jobs or work-related commitment harm the sleep-wake cycles of the body. The disruption then causes sleep deprivation. People who are night shifters and also those who regularly travel have an irregular sleep pattern and they often don’t get to sleep enough.</p><p>Young children and teenagers require more hours of sleep than adults do but they are unable to do so due to their studies and school. Teenagers, especially, sleep late because of school assignments and exams and wake up early because of an early school schedule. All of this contributes towards the disruption in their sleep-wake cycle.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Sleeping Habits and the Environment</h3><p>The type of environment you sleeps in has a great effect on your sleeping pattern. A loud neighborhood, extreme temperatures or a snoring partner can disrupt sleep to a great extent. New parents are faced with lack of sleep because especially mothers have to wake up at different intervals in the night to feed or care for their babies.</p><p>Habits also contribute to sleep deprivation. Those individuals, who are into longer screen times before going to bed, end up getting a reduced sleep.</p><img src="images/inbook/part-1-2-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img" /><p>Insomnia is completely different to sleep deprivation as it relates to a problem in initiating or maintaining sleep. It is a condition that occurs to someone who has faced difficulty while sleeping at night. It is associated with sleep deprivation and affects many people around the globe. The causes of insomnia are many and all these lead to sleep deprivation. Some of the major causes are anxiety, neurotransmitter imbalances, depression, psychiatric issues and environmental factors.</p><p>The severity of insomnia is determined by the amount of time it takes to sleep and also from the frequency of difficulties one faces while sleeping. Most people suffer from acute insomnia and this should be separated from the persistent one that goes on for at least a month.</p><p>Below are some of the tips to overcome insomnia. All these points will be discussed in detail in the next few parts.</p><ul><li>Keep all other activities other than sleeping away from the bed. Use the bed only for sleeping. Using smartphones or other active things before sleeping conditions the body and mind that the bed is a place to remain active and alert.</li><li>Set your clock by getting out of the bed at the same time, each day.</li><li>Avoid keeping the bed too hot or too cold.</li><li>Regular exercise helps to initiate sleep and deepens it further.</li><li>A good diet such as low- fat food and consumption of milk also helps solve the problem of insomnia. Green vegetables and fruits should also be the part of your diet to kill the effects of insomnia.</li><li>A peaceful environment before bedtime plays an important role in correcting the sleeping routine. Insomnia can be reduced by reducing the light exposure as much as possible, before going to bed.</li><li>There are amazing scents available that can help calm down your brain and body thus making you feel comfortable in the environment you are sleeping in.</li><li>Homeopathic medicines made from various ingredients are available to tackle the harmful effects of insomnia.</li></ul><h3 class="intext-h3">Sleep Apnea</h3><p>Sleep apnea is a health condition that also leads to sleep deprivation. In this condition, the upper airway collapses while an individual is sleeping. This leads to a reduced airflow to the lungs. The disruption in lungs causes the individual to wake up at night due to an insufficient supply of oxygen.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Illness of any kind</h3><p>A cold or a bad cough can cause breathing problems while a person sleeps. The problem in breathing causes an individual to wake up at different intervals in the night. These frequent waking ups cause a disruption in sleep, which leads to sleep deprivation.</p><p>A person who is sleep deprived goes into a sleep debt. The sleep debt is accumulated over the time. It is important to make up for this debt because it ends up causing major health problems that can also lead to death. If an individual is chronically sleep deprived then he/she needs to look up at various changes that can help change their lifestyle. In the next few chapters, we will guide you through the different ways and paths that you can follow to make a change for a better life. The most effective way of dealing with sleep problems in not popping a pill but it involves all kind of ways that are harmless and much more effective.</p><p>In the next two sections, we will discuss some of the most important terms that are associated with sleep, Circadian Rhythm and the two sleep hormones, Melatonin and Serotonin.</p>'

        name: "What are Circadian Rhythms?",
        text:
          '<img src="images/inbook/part-1-3-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>The term Circadian Rhythm has been used a few times earlier but never been explained in detail. In this part of the book, we will take a look at this phenomenon and how does it contribute towards our sleep.</p><p>Have you ever felt active and drowsy at the same time every day? This situation is quite common among people around the globe and circadian rhythm is one to blame. Circadian Rhythm is described as a 24- hour clock that is running internally in the background of our brains. This clock cycles between sleepiness and alertness all day and is also called the sleep/ wake cycle.</p><p>Adults usually face the biggest dip in their energies in the middle of the night and sometimes just after lunch when they require a post-lunch nap. The time of the dip can vary according to your sleep habits. People who are night owls might face the dip at a different time as compared to a morning person. If an individual is caught up on his/ her sleep, then they might not feel the dip and the rise of their circadian rhythms but those who are sleep deprived may strongly feel the fluctuations that are caused by constant swings between sleepiness and alertness. These rhythms are important in determining the sleeping and feeding patterns in both animals and human beings.</p><p>In a simple cycle, melatonin, hormone that regulates sleep patterns, will begin to rise in the evening, will reach its highest peak at night and then start dropping gradually as the sun rises. We will discuss this hormone later.</p><p>When a day turns to night, melatonin production starts. This occurs every night because it is natural and the brain starts signaling the body that it is time to rest and sleep. Changing seasons can cause great confusion to your circadian rhythms and this confusion can make sleeping hard. As one gets older, melatonin’s production starts reducing. This is the reason why adults can function on fewer hours of sleep as compared to children or teenagers.</p><p>A person’s circadian rhythm might be disrupted if he/she finds hard to sleep at night and wake up in the morning. It does not necessarily mean that a human being is suffering from sleep deprivation but it mostly means that a person’s sleep-wake cycle is not normal. People who are night shifters or those who travel a lot suffer from circadian rhythm disorders. There are a few disorders related to circadian rhythms and these are explained below.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase</h3><p>It is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder and it majorly consists of a delayed sleep pattern. The pattern is delayed by two or more hours. The reason behind the delay is that a person’s internal sleep clock is shifted later at night. The patient sleeps normally once he falls into it. The delay created can be socially acceptable as long as it does not interfere with work or social demands.</p><p>An individual who suffers from delay sleep-wake phase sleeps late and wakes up late too. The sleep is good but is just delayed by a few hours. One symptom of this disorder is finding it hard to sleep at night. Another one is finding it difficult to wake up in the morning. Due to these two reasons, this phase is often confused with insomnia.</p><p>A person should also analyze other reasons that might be causing this disruption such as any other sleeping disorder, a mental health disorder, a medical condition or a medication use. This phase is considered to be common in teens and young adults. People who are night owls or are more productive in the evening are likely to go through this phase every night. This book can guide you in many ways in which this short delay can be prevented like having a glass of milk before bedtime can make sleep come faster or creating a suitable environment at bedtime can prevent the delay.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Advanced Sleep-Wake Phase</h3><p>This phase occurs in people who sleep at times which are not normal sleep times. The people who suffer from this disorder have an early bird circadian clock which means that they tend to sleep hours before than normal sleep times and also wake up earlier than most people. These people then feel drowsy in the late afternoon. The circadian rhythm in these people also occurs earlier than the rest. The hormone, melatonin releases before the normal bedtime. The body temperature curve is also moved earlier, which acts as a major symptom of this disorder.</p><p>Some people follow this phase quite well but the issue arises when they start feeling sleepy and less productive in the late afternoon. People usually confuse waking up early with insomnia or depression. People with advanced sleep-wake phase can adopt their lifestyle according to their sleep patterns like, for example, they can do jobs that require them to do an early morning shift. Some people, however, tend to worsen this disorder by consuming coffee or pills at night to delay their sleep. This doesn’t help but only create more problems. This book has every kind of solution for this problem. Choose the solution that suits you the best for example napping can help solve this problem. People who nap in the afternoon are more likely to stay active till night which means that they don’t tend to sleep early, before bedtime. The benefits of napping are discussed in one of the chapters.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm</h3><p>People with this disorder face a disorganized sleep-wake pattern. Their sleep pattern doesn’t follow the normal sleep times at night. Those individuals who suffer from this disorder sleep off and on in a series of naps over the whole day. This is not a fixed sleep pattern but rather a broken one. This is how an infant sleeps, wakes up for a few hours and then sleeps again for another few hours. Their sleep is broken into pieces.</p><p>Some of the symptoms of this order include sleeping on and off, having a hard time sleeping well or having a total sleep time, which is not sufficient for their age. This disorder is rare and people who suffer have a weak body clock. Individuals who suffer from Dementia, Brain Damage or Mental retardation usually suffer from irregular rhythms. Bad sleep patterns and habits may contribute towards this disorder. People who do not get a proper exposure to light might also feel their sleep patterns getting disturbed. Irregular sleep-wake rhythms can be controlled by exercise and good, balanced diet. Exercise can help people stay alert and active whenever they feel like napping. A balanced diet can also assist in the same way. We will discuss both of these things in detail, in the coming chapters.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Non-24 Hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm</h3><p>The sleeping pattern of people suffering from this disorder is shifted every day. Sleep time and wake time continues to shift later and later every day. The sleep time worsens as weeks go by. As sleep times drifts further and further, the person finds that he is awake until the morning. This leads to the person sleeping in the morning hours. It then moves to late afternoon and evening. After more days, the person then gets back to sleeping during normal night hours. The whole drifting sleep continues again.</p><p>Unlike the irregular sleep phase, the sleep is not broken into naps. The sleep is only broken if there are external disturbances. Individuals who suffer from blindness usually have Non-24 Hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm. Daylight and other physical activities are important in resetting sleep clocks. People with delayed phase disorder are sometimes deemed to suffer from Non- 24-Hour Sleep- Wake rhythm. This book can help you get a fixed sleep pattern each day.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Jobs Involving Shift Work</h3><p>People, who are involved in jobs that occur at the time when most people sleep, usually suffer from Shift Work Disorder. In this disorder, the individual’s circadian rhythms are confused with the person’s work schedule. The person is at work when the body wants to rest or sleep. The conflict here leads to this disorder. Shift Work disorder causes trouble in sleeping. The person is always tired, fatigued and exhausted. This can hurt their performance at work. There are many variations of shift work schedules that can cause this problem. Night owls can adjust easily to an evening shift or a night shift as compared to early morning shifts. On the other hand, morning larks can find it easy to work in the early morning shifts. In the last chapter of this book, we have discussed various ways shift workers can improve their sleep, for example, reducing the consumption of coffee or by reducing exposure to light before bedtime.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Jet Lag</h3><p>Jet lag occurs to an individual who travels through different time zones and finds issues adjusting to the new schedules. When an individual travels for a long distance while being in the air, his circadian rhythms may still be following the previous time zone. The body might expect to sleep when it is daytime in the new time zone or it might expect to be awake when it is nighttime. It is a temporary condition and occurs when an individual travels between at least two time zones. Jet lag can be worsened by sleep loss, use of caffeine, air pressure or stress.</p><p>This part that you have just finished reading was all about circadian rhythms. This term will be widely used throughout this book and now that you have a clear idea of what it all about, you can easily relate to the context in the coming chapters.</p>'

        name: "Why Is A Good Production Of Melatonin And Serotonin Essential?",
        text:
          "<p>The core reason behind a good night sleep is the perfect balance of sleep hormones, Melatonin and Serotonin. Both these hormones regulate various functions in our bodies such as mood and sleep.</p><p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. In simple terms, Serotonin is responsible for sending messages between the cells of the nerves and then in result producing appropriate responses.</p><p>Melatonin is a neurotransmitter-like substance. It is vital in regulating the circadian rhythm, which further controls sleeping patterns, body’s temperature and the body’s ability to release hormones.</p><p>The difference between these two hormones is simply like day and night. They have opposite functions and yet they are required to work together in peace so that the body does not suffer from any imbalance. Serotonin is a happiness-causing hormone. It is naturally produced by the body and is considered as a feel-good hormone that increases positivity and relaxation. It makes a human being feel energized. This energy helps an individual wake up in the morning and wipes away all the last night’s tiredness.</p><p>Melatonin, totally opposite to Serotonin, is considered the hormone of the darkness. The name given to this hormone has a reason. The reason is that it is produced in the pineal gland of the brain when an individual is found in a dark environment or surrounding. It is always considered essential to switch off the lights or wear a sleep mask before going for sleep. This is because the change in lights helps the eye to send a message to the brain that more melatonin should be produced. This melatonin produced relaxes the body and prepares it for a sleep stage. Without the production of melatonin, it would be impossible to get a sound and relaxed sleep which will affect the body’s functioning at night.</p><p>The level of melatonin production increases at night or in the dark, while the production of serotonin is boosted in the daylight. In simple terms, melatonin helps in sleeping while serotonin keeps us awake. A lack of each can cause various problems. A Decrease in Melatonin’s production can lead to sleeplessness and insomnia while a lack of serotonin in the body can result in depression and tiredness all day.</p><p>For a good night’s sleep, it is important to boost the level of melatonin and reduce the levels of serotonin in the body. To boost melatonin one should dim the lights in the evening and avoid using any type of screen. Mediation also helps to wind down. In the morning, boost serotonin level by moving out in the sunlight. Cherries are rich in melatonin and bananas and milk help</p><p>increase its production. Foods such as eggs, chicken, and nuts are rich in serotonin and they give enough energy to tackle the busy day ahead.</p><p>This chapter was about the knowledge that one needs before they start this book. In the next chapter, we will guide you through all the ways and tactics that can help improve your sleeping habits. The journey is tough but just by making few changes; we will help get you to your right destination.</p>"

    name: "Improve Your Sleeping Habits",
    text:
      '<img src="images/inbook/part-2-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>What you do is what you are. Your habits, hobbies and, activities define you and design your way of life. It is very important to choose appropriate hobbies and adopt good habits so you and your health do not suffer from various deficiencies and disorders that exist. This is just similar to how we choose good clothes for ourselves and crave for good company etc. Why do we do that? The answer is pretty straightforward. We do that because we are defined by how we look, how we talk, our relationships, our daily routines and much more. Like all these things, having good sleep habits are also important as these also define us. People who don’t tend to sleep well at night are usually tired and constantly found yawning during their work hours. Such people are considered lazy by their peers and bosses. The impression built by these individuals is completely negative.</p><p>People who have a good night sleep or generally sleep well are active and energized throughout the day. Such people are often cheerful because they do not face those mood swings that generally occur due to sleep deprivation. Such people have personalities that emit the energies they have within themselves because of the sound sleep they take. Good sleep no doubt shapes up the mind and also the thinking pattern. It also affects your body language and how you carry them.</p><p>There is more to this. Sleep habits are not the only things that need to be changed but our general habits that make up our lifestyle need to be changed as well to create a positive impact on our sleep. Sometimes it is hard to break habits that we are so used to, like playing games late at night, chatting, texting and watching movies. Those who love coffee and sugary food can’t keep themselves away from them. Although, it is hard to change habits as they become addictions but do you think they are good for your health and sleep? They are definitely not, It’s hard to completely keep yourself away from them but you can gradually decrease the time you spend enjoying these habits. It is hard but not impossible.</p><p>Good sleep habits lead to good sleep patterns. You can sleep multiple times in a day and feel as great as when having 4 hours of sleep. A sleep pattern is something that a body uses to analyze when to sleep and when to wake up. There are various sleeping patterns that human beings have adopted around the world. A little information about some of the patterns created by humans is given below:</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Monophasic Sleep Pattern- One Sleep per Day</h3><p>This is a normal sleeping pattern. On average, a person sleeps for at least 8 hours every night. It is the most used and common sleeping pattern, which most societies follow.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Biphasic Sleep Pattern- 2 Periods of Sleep per Day</h3><p>The people who follow this pattern, sleep two times a day. It is made up of a long sleep at night and a shorter nap in the day. Taking afternoon naps is considered common in countries like Spain. A short nap in the afternoon provides deep refreshment and is equal to a long sleep. Some people who follow this pattern take longer naps, approximately 90 minutes long. This works great because the body gets time to complete its sleep cycle and the person then wakes up feeling refreshed and energized.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Polyphasic Sleep Pattern-Multiple Sleeps per Day</h3><p>In this pattern, people generally sleep for four to six periods during the day. There are several combinations of polyphasic sleep patterns but the most common are Everyman, Uberman, and Dymaxion. Everyman Sleep Pattern involves a sleep of no longer than three hours. It is then followed by three 20-minute naps for the refreshment every day. It is an easy and quite sustainable sleep pattern but it requires determination and willpower during sleep deprivation phase in the first two weeks of starting it.</p><p>Uberman makes use of six naps of maximum thirty minutes throughout the day. This pattern can help an individual get asleep, which is as good as a three hours sleep. This pattern is least flexible and if a nap gets missed, there is a chance of falling into sleep deprivation. This pattern stretches to the limits but it is possible.</p><p>The Dymaxion pattern involves 30-minute naps after every six hours. This is a sleep pattern that is least used or adopted by people because it definitely leads to sleep deprivation with only 2 hours of sleep every night.</p><p>The above three patterns are human-created and can be adapted according to one’s sleeping habits.</p><p>In the next few pages of this chapter, you will see how small things such as alarm clocks and pillows can help make a change in your sleeping patterns. The idea here is that there are many ways but an individual should stick to the way that suits him/her the best.</p>',

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-2-1-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Alarm clocks are the most common things available in probably every bedroom but do they contribute towards getting us a good sleep? So many people need to wake up on a set time because of jobs, schools and other responsibilities. This is only possible if they sleep on a set time. Therefore, it is natural for people to depend on alarm clocks.</p><p>People have used alarm clocks for centuries because they help people wake up and sleep at the time of their choice. The benefits of alarm clocks are undeniable and there are many people who find waking up impossible, without their sound clock.</p><p>Alarm clocks help to establish a regular bedtime routine which not only improves your sleeping patterns but also help you feel faster once you get used to this pattern and make it a habit. Changing sleep times every day can interfere with your circadian rhythms. Setting an alarm clock makes sure that you sleep and wake up on a fixed time each day. Sticking with the same sleep and wake time each day improve your sleep hygiene.</p><p>The best thing you can do for achieving the same sleep routine each night is to set an alarm for 10 if you want to sleep at 10:30 pm. This will act as a signal to shut down everything and get and prepare yourself for bedtime.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">How to Improve the Usage of Alarm Clocks?</h3><p>Here are some of the ways one can adapt by using alarm clocks effectively:</p><ol><li>Avoid hitting the snooze button by setting alarm clocks early. Hitting the snooze button at various intervals only disrupts the sleep. Set the alarm clock at the time when it is necessary to wake up.</li><li>Use an alarm clock with has blue numbers as compared to the one with red.</li><li>Experts discourage the alarm clocks that emit bright lights. These are sleep-disrupting lights.</li><li>Keep the clock away from you or keep its face in the opposite direction to help you to let go of looking at the clock.</li><li>Try using an app or an alarm clock that emits soothing sounds so that one doesn’t wake up all frightened.</li><li>Alarm clocks take away the effort of waking up at different intervals at night to look at the time. These are one of the best inventions and should be used appropriately.</li></ol>'

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-2-2-img-1.jpg" class="intext-img float-right" /><p>Our gadgets, smartphones, and other electronic items have become such a huge part of our lives that it is hard rather impossible to keep them away, even during bedtime. Technology has affected our sleep in ways we can’t even imagine. We have become addicted to everything electronic. It doesn’t matter if you are playing a video game, or surfing the net; the technology of any kind contributes a great deal towards a restless sleep.</p><p>Below are some of the ways in which electronic devices disrupt our sleep:</p><ol><li>Devices such as smartphones or television play a vital role in suppressing the production of melatonin. The blue light emitted by any type of screen restricts the production of melatonin in our body. The reduction in melatonin, as discussed in the previous chapter, disturbs the sleep-wake cycle and makes it hard to sleep. People generally use electronics within an hour before bedtime. This is a wrong practice and should be avoided.</li><li>People usually think that it is harmless to answer a few emails or watch their favorite movie before bedtime. Well, that is not the case. This is not only harmful but it also triggers the brain to remain alert and awake for a few more hours. Coming across through something exciting while surfing the internet or reading a negative comment about you makes it hard for the brain to relax at night. Those experiences do not let the brain settle and you end up constantly think about the things you just read or saw. This is harmful to the brain as after spending the whole day with technology, the brain needs to unwind and that is only possible if you sleep peacefully.</li><li>Keeping a mobile phone beside your pillow can disturb your sleep and wake you up, thanks to the chimes of texts, notification, emergency calls or calendar reminders. It has been observed that a large number of people keep at least one gadget in their rooms. This makes it hard to sleep at night and then wake up for school in the morning.</li><li>Our body feels hungry when we don’t get enough sleep as sleep deficiency slows down the body’s metabolism. The use of smartphones, before going to bed, can induce cravings, which leads to having snacks and gaining weight.</li><li>Going to bed late at night can damage your skin. This can lead to dark circles around the eyes, puffy lines etc. The blue light emitted by smartphones triggers the production of cortisol, which damages the smoothness and elasticity of the skin.</li></ol><p>The point here is not to just cry on how technology has ruined our lives, but the purpose is to find ways to live healthy and happy in today’s world without becoming the slaves of technology. Below are some of the tips that one can adapt to create a difference.</p><ol><li>Give yourself at least 30 minutes of gadget-free time before going to bed.</li><li>Keep your smartphone in airplane mode while you are sleeping.</li><li>Restrict yourself from checking any emails or messages, 2 hours before bedtime.</li><li>Keep all the electronic devices away from your room especially do not keep a televisionin the room.</li><li>Parents should limit their kid’s use of technology in the bedroom.</li><li>Fix the discomfort caused by the eerie blue light and the bright light coming from your screen through f.lux. F.lux fixes the color of the screen of your computer according to the time of the day. F.lux changes the screen color to a warm color at night while in the morning the screen shines like daylight. People who stay up late at night because of their computers can use f.lux to help them sleep better. F.lux makes sure that the computer screen you use looks like the room you are staying in. You just have to inform f.lux the type of lights you are surrounded with and the place you live in. F.lux can sort out the rest.</li></ol>'

        text:
          '<img src="images/inbook/part-2-3-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Having a good sleep is a fundamental part of a healthy lifestyle. It keeps our body healthy, keeps the brain sharp and is good for improving our memory. There is no formula or magic spell to catch the sleep but there are various sounds that can help one fall into his/her dreamland. The variety of sounds, available are endless but it is important to analyze, which type of sound suits you the best. Personality traits play a great role in deciding what type of sound can make someone fall asleep.</p><p>The most common type of sound that helps people sleep is the white noise. This noise is made up of many frequencies with equal intensities. Due to its consistency, it helps a human being to fall asleep. The sound from this noise masks the noise of the tinnitus. There are two kinds of sleeping habits. Some people find it hard to sleep in complete silence while some people cannot sleep when there is too much noise. White noise breaks the silence because, well it is a noise. However, the question here is that how does it help in situations when there is a lot of noise around? White noise drowns out the sounds in the environment and makes way for itself by paving over their randomness with something more consistent.</p><p>Just like white noise, there are many other colors of noise that can prove to be fit for some sleepers. Pink noise is just like white noise except that it has a different distribution. The lower frequencies in pink noise are louder and the higher frequencies are softer. Green noise is considered to be the background noise of the earth and is quite similar to pink noise.</p><p>Blue noise is like pink noise but inverted. It is the higher frequencies that are emphasized here. Violet noise is used as a treatment for tinnitus. The higher pitched noise can mask the tinnitus noise well. Whereas black noise is related to silence or noise cancellation.</p><p>People who sleep with low-frequency sounds can try pink noise. Those who do not mind loud sounds can go for violet noise before sleeping.</p><p>People who are not keen on white sounds or other similar types of sounds can use nature sounds to help them sleep. Nature sounds are ideal for sleeping because they include predictable fluctuations in frequency and loudness. These fluctuations don’t interfere with sleep and are great for masking other sounds. Imagine how the sound of rain takes over the sounds of loud neighbors. Nature’s sounds have an amazing noise-canceling power. Winter wind, waterfall, and birds, forest sounds, rain and thunder, oceans, birdsong and stream in a cave are some of the most popular and effective nature sounds that can help you sleep better.</p><p>Other than sounds, music also helps to sleep well. The type of music, although, depends on the personality of the person listening. Some people go for soft music before they fall asleep while some listen to hard rock before their bedtime.</p>'

          '<p>Regular exercise not only makes you feel better during the day but also help in sleeping better at night. Exercise can benefit your sleep in many unimaginable ways. Many scientific pieces of evidence prove that exercise helps improving sleep. Exercise contributes towards a restful sleep and also helps fight sleep issues such as insomnia.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">How Can Exercise Affect Your Sleep?</h3><p>Exercise improves the quality of sleep. Any kind of physical activity increases the time spent in deep sleep. The deeper the sleep, the more boosted a human’s nervous system gets. Deep sleep also supports the cardiac health of an individual.</p><p>Exercise helps in increasing the duration of one’s nightly rest. Any kind of physical activity requires the body to expend energy thus making it feel tired and crave for a long rest at night. Exercise, if done consistently, helps to sleep longer without any breaks or intervals.</p><p>A proper exercise routine helps in reducing the stress levels. Walk, especially, is considered beneficial to fight against high-stress levels. Stress is one of the most common hindrances towards a restless and sound sleep. Exercise is a tried and tested remedy for anxiety and other types of mood swings. Exercise triggers anti-anxiety responses in the body and helps you to feel good and positive. Yoga helps to calm down the nervous system and helps you to relax. Mind- body exercises also help to reduce the cortisol levels and control blood pressure.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Exercise and Insomnia</h3><p>Exercise is treated as an effective therapy for the treatment of insomnia. Aerobic exercises are very effective in helping reduce insomnia symptoms. The benefits of exercise kick in gradually rather than immediately. Exercise helps in reducing the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and also reduces the severity of sleep apnea.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">How Much Exercise Is Required?</h3><p>There is no set rule and requirement may vary from person to person. Doctors and experts say that an exercise of 30 minutes each day for five days is essential for a good sleep. People who face difficulty in sleeping should follow a consistent exercise routine so their body and mind are very much aware. Surprisingly, over-training or too much exercise can lead to sleep problems and also insomnia. One should avoid too much physical activity and keep it consistent and easy.</p><p>Exercising too close to bedtime may not work at all. Working out closer to the night can leave you energized and you may then have trouble sleeping. The body temperature stays high for about four hours after exercise and a high temperature makes it impossible for the body to get into its rest mode. One can perform gentle exercises such as stretching and yoga but that too within three to four hours of bedtime.</p><p>Therefore, get out, walk, and hit a gym or jog. The choice is yours. Every bit of exercise or physical activity makes you feel healthy during the day and helps you sleep soundly during the night.</p>'

          '<p>Young children and elderly people take nap and it is considered a very important part in many societies and cultures. In today’s world, people are becoming more sleep deprived and our busy lifestyle is one to be blamed. Our work and never-ending social activities avoid us to take naps during a day. 20-30 minutes nap during a day not only helps reduce sleep deficiency but also improve mood, performance and the ability to stay alert when needed. If you have trouble sleeping at night, shorten or cut down naps entirely.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Types of Naps</h3><ol><li><u><strong>Planned Napping</strong></u>: This involves taking a nap before one actually gets sleepy.</li><li><u><strong>Emergency Napping</strong></u>: This kind of napping occurs when a person suddenly feels tired and fatigued and is unable to continue work.</li><li><u><strong>Habitual Napping</strong></u>: This is a kind of practice that happens every day. When a person takes a nap at the same time, every day then he is said to follow habitual napping. Young children usually nap at the same time after school and most adults take an after lunch nap each day.</li></ol><h3 class="intext-h3">Tips for a Perfect Nap</h3><p>A short nap of maximum 30 minutes is recommended for better alertness and performance. This kind of nap doesn’t interfere with nighttime sleep as well.</p><p>A suitable sleep environment plays an important role in providing you a good nap. Make sure you have access to a dark place with a normal temperature. Try to limit the noise and the intensity of the light entering the room.</p><p>A nap too late in the day can affect your sleep pattern and create problems in sleeping. A nap too early in the day may cause the body to not take sleep at all. An afternoon nap is always considered perfect.</p><p>Driving, while sleeping is considered quite harmful. Everyone knows that but in spite of that, there are many drivers who do not take rest and continue driving even when they are feeling drowsy. Just as full night’s sleep before driving is considered good, taking a short nap before driving reduces the risk of drivers falling into sleep. This not only protects them but also protect other people on the road.</p><p>Night shift workers are faced with fatigue and poor performance due to their abnormal work schedules. Taking naps for them is essential as it improves their alertness and overall performance. Napping before work acts as a powerful strategy for remaining productive in a night shift.</p><p>Once you have woken up from a nap, expose yourself to bright light and do some quick exercise to restore your alertness.</p><p>Napping is usually associated with laziness and young children and adults in many cultures. This is wrong as it is for everyone and it doesn’t define laziness but it leads to more productivity. Sleep inertia might accompany a nap, which is 30 minutes long or more. Sleep inertia is a period of grogginess that is followed by sleep.</p><p>Therefore, this was all you could learn in this chapter; however, the knowledge gained in this one will continue to be useful in the next few chapters.</p>'

This means that it can help people sleep faster at night and wake up early and refreshed in the morning. Below are three simple hacks that can help you follow a single bedtime routine every night.</p><ul><li>Set up an alarm every night: If you want to sleep at 11 every night, set an alarm for 10:30 so you are reminded of closing everything and preparing yourself for bed. If you sleep at a set time every night, you will not need an alarm to wake you up in the morning.</li><li>Follow a wind-down routine: A good wind-down routine such as reading a book, or taking a warm shower or performing an exercise can help wind you down and prepare you for bedtime. Make sure your routine is also carried out at a fixed time to avoid overlapping it with your sleep time routine.</li><li>Step away from your digital assets: Stay away from your cell phones and other digital assets.

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-3-1-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Too much light at night can disrupt a healthy sleep, increasing the risk of sleep disorders and health issues. According to experts, nighttime lightening may contribute to making us obese, causing depression and sometimes might play a part in causing cancer. It is usually found that people who switch on the television or keep the light on while sleeping, are faced by the fear of darkness. These people, to overcome this fear, are required to spend more time in the dark until it becomes easier and comfortable to sleep in the dark.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">How Does Light Affect the Sleep/Wake Cycle?</h3><p>Our body’s internal clock, including the sleep/wake cycle, is dependent on light exposure. The increased light exposure at night reduces the production of melatonin. This suppression of melatonin in result causes sleep deprivation and is the reason behind many sleep disorders found in a human being. Exposure to bright light in the evening or midnight pushes the sleep/wake cycle back by a few hours, making one sleep late in the evening, the night that follows. Contrary to this, exposure to bright light in the morning when one wakes up pushes the sleep/wake cycle forward. Those people who have live chaotic sleep habits and disrupted sleep/wake cycle are prone to various sleep disorders and health problems.</p><p>The relation between nighttime lighting, sleep disorders, and health problem are quite strong. Shift work is recognized as a risk factor for developing prostate cancer in men. The exposure towards the light at night affects the sleep/wake cycle of night shifters and makes them more vulnerable to cancer and other health problems.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Risks Associated With Poor Light Controls at Night</h3><p>It is important to overcome the fear of dark at night and keep the lights off. The consequences of keeping the light on are quite harmful. A few of the risks associated with poor light controls at night are given below.</p><ul><u><strong>Depression</strong></u>: Sleep deficiency and disorders are linked to depression. The abnormality in the sleep/wake cycle disturbs the internal clock of the body, thus causing disorders such as insomnia. Insomnia is one of the most common causes of depression.</li><li><u><strong>Cancer</strong></u>: An exposure to light at night is one of the most common reasons for causing breast cancer in women.</li><li><u><strong>Reproduction System</strong></u>: Female shift workers, who are exposed to light at night, are more likely to face disturbances in their menstrual cycles. The increased time spent on the shift increases the risk of irregular cycles. The chaotic sleep/wake cycle can interfere with the fertility in women and may harm it with time.</li><li><u><strong>Obesity</strong></u>: Nighttime lighting affects the eating schedules as well. People, who are exposed to light at night, tend to eat more at night because of their hunger increases. These odd eating habits can then lead to obesity.</li></ul><h3 class="intext-h3">How To Improve Light Controls?</h3><ol><li>Face the light when you wake up. Start your day by getting out of bed and looking out of the window to get enough daylight. Daylight triggers the production of serotonin and helps drop the production of melatonin in the body. This practice will help set the internal clock and actually help you sleep better. Exercise during the day in an open area to absorb as much sunlight as possible. If its winter and you are short of daylight, try exposing yourself to blue light or rebalance your circadian rhythms.</li><li>Turn off all kinds of screen, television, mobiles, tablets, before going to bed. Set them off an hour before the bedtime.</li><li>Use curtains or blinds to lock the lights coming from outside the room.</li><li>Red/orange lights do not affect the circadian rhythms as compared to white or blue light. If someone does want to keep the lights on, the use dim red light is recommended.</li></ol>'

Your sleep environment could be important to good sleep habits for many reasons. First, you need to analyze whether you like where you sleep. If you enter your bedroom, do you feel relaxed and at peace? If not, then why not? Below are some of the changes you can create in your environment to enhance your sleep.</p><p><u><strong>Avoid any clutter and give everything a proper place</strong></u>: Spend some time picking up dirty clothes from the floor or bed. People who work from home should keep their workspace outside the bedroom. Avoid keeping television and computers in your bedroom but if you have no other place, keep these closed in a cabinet to avoid using them at night.</p><p><u><strong>Keep a comfortable mattress</strong></u>: We will discuss in detail in the next part of this chapter. Spending a little money on a good mattress will be a good investment for your healthy future. A comfortable mattress can be a good prevention from back-pains, insomnia, and many other problems. Investment in nice bed linens can also create a difference.</p><p><u><strong>Room Temperature</strong></u>: The room temperature should be just right. Avoid making your room uncomfortably hot or cold. Try keeping your air-conditioner on a temperature in which you do not feel cold. Feeling too cold can make it hard for you to sleep. Heat vents and open windows can also be adjusted accordingly. Defining a temperature range for everyone might be hard because the temperature that might be comfortable for you might not be for someone else. Memory foam pillows might be very comfortable for sleep but they get too hot at night so they must be avoided.</p><p><u><strong>Sounds</strong></u>: As discussed earlier, choose the right kind of noise you feel will help you sleep. Those who prefer sleeping in silence can try closing their doors and windows or can use earplugs to restrict any kind of sound reaching their ears.</p><p>Think about the comfortable bedroom you slept in and by applying this strategy in your sleep space, you can conquer all your nighttime demons that disturb your sleep.</p>'

A good mattress is a gear we need for a good night sleep and there is no doubt that a suitable mattress helps in preventing various health issues including insomnia, back pains etc. People usually blame their budgets for continuing to sleep on a less than ideal mattress but the question is can anyone put a price tag on their sleep? It is one of the most important things to get and should not be taken for granted.</p><p>Below are some of the ways a mattress affects your sleep and health.</p><р3 class="intext-h3">A New Mattress Can Decrease Your Stress</р3><p>Change is always good. Sleeping on a new, fresh and firm mattress can contribute to decreasing stress, anxiety, nervousness, headaches and much more. It helps in increasing the sleep quality and decrease in back pain associated with a firmness of the mattress. All mattresses eventually decline in their support, so it is important to replace a mattress after every 8 to 10 years.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Allergies Caused By a Mattress</h3><p>It is important to change/ or wash a mattress before it becomes home to dust mites. Dust mites feed on the dead skin you shed on your bed. These can cause trouble in sleeping especially for those people who suffer from asthma. Make it a hobby to clean your pillows and bed sheets in hot water to get rid of dust mites. Cleaning the mattress with a vacuum can also help kill the dust mites.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">The Correct Firmness of the Mattress</h3><p>One cannot know which mattress suit them the best until they lie down over it, horizontally. There are both firm and soft mattresses available. There is no set definition of a soft mattress. Person A can find a mattress soft while person B can find the same mattress firm. At least 20 minutes should be spent lying on the mattress before purchasing it. It is important to pay attention to pressure points when choosing a bed.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Incline your bed</h3><p>Inclining your bed can help you sleep better as it helps you to breath better if you suffer from cold or sleep apnea. By putting some bricks under the legs of the bed you can raise the angle of the bed where you place your head. This proves to be an idea for sleep because it avoids your feet from getting cold and head from getting too hot at night. The inclined position of the bed will make your feet feel warm and make it easy for you to sleep. A wedge under your pillow can also help to raise your head.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Do Not Use Your Bed as a Home Office</h3><p>This is an undeniable fact that a bedroom should only be used for sleep. If not done so, the brain is expected to answer emails and messages at the time when it is supposed to hit the bed. Beds should be kept away from any kind of electronic devices.</p><p>All the above are healthy and quite easy tips that one can apply to their mattresses and improve their sleep patterns.</p>'

Natural fibers help our body to breathe while synthetic bedding absorbs moisture making it uncomfortable to sleep well.</p><p>Wrinkle-free or no-iron fabrics should be avoided because they contain perfluorinated chemicals. Such chemicals can harm your skin. Bedding with polyester should also be avoided as it contains plastic. Plastic contributes to various health problems and also it does not induce sleep.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Convert to Natural fiber</h3><p>We want to be cool enough so our bodies can sleep but warm enough so that we are comfortable when we sleep. It is also advised to wear breathable, loose and feel-good fabric at night for the most comfortable sleep. There is no one fabric for all. Some people sweat a lot while they sleep while some feel cold. It is important to choose the right fabric that caters to their body and environment. We have listed down a few of the natural fabrics that are readily available and best for nighttime.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Cotton</h3><p>Cotton is a soft fiber used in textile for a long time. It is soft and lightweight. It is extremely durable and easy to wash. It is also easy to care for. Some disadvantages of this fiber can be that it does not insulate well, which means one needs to take another blanket over the cotton one to sleep well. It also absorbs moisture, which means if a person sweats a lot at night; the cotton blanket might absorb the moisture making it uncomfortable to sleep at night.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Wool</h3><p>Wool is made up of natural hair of goat or sheep. Wool is a good insulator thus a wool blanket keeps one warm at night. Wool, such as merino wool, is soft and breathable thus making it best to be used for a sleepwear. However, wool can be quite expensive to purchase and some wools might be not suitable for some bodies as they tend to be itchy.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Silk</h3><p>Silk pajamas and silk bed sheets are probably the only things that make you look like a royalty at night. Silk is considered incredibly soft and strong. It is an excellent thermoregulator, which means it keeps you warm when it is cold and keeps the body’s temperature cold when it is warm outside. However, silk absorbs a lot of moisture and also perspiration can stain silk. The later might damage the skin so it is always advised to clean up the pajamas or bed sheets before wearing them.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Linen</h3><p>Just like silk, linen is considered a luxury fabric. It is also way more expensive than other types of fabrics. Linen is popular because it is breathable and cool. Those living in hot climates should consider wearing linen sleepwear and using linen bed sheets for their beds. Linen wrinkles easily, which is a proof that there is no added chemical in the fabric to make it wrinkle-free.</p><p>You may find that natural material doesn’t breathe as well but their advantages are far superior to their disadvantages. They can be expensive but it is worth buying them.</p>'

Scents of a different kind also help to make one sleep soundly. Below, we have mentioned some fragrances that can help one sleep better.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Lavender</h3><p>This plant has been used for ages to fight against anxiety and agitation. The smell of lavender slows down the nervous system, which provides a relaxing feeling to the body. This helps to improve sleep quality. The scent can be mixed with oil and massaged on the body. The effects produced are beneficial for a good night sleep.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Vanilla</h3><p>Smelling the scent of vanilla while stressed can normalize the heartbeat and improve blood pressure.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Valerian</h3><p>Valerian is famous for reducing anxiety if taken orally. The fragrance of valerian can make you sleep faster and longer than any other scent available. The smell of valerian is not so refreshing so people who prefer refreshing smells can substitute valerian with a rose.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Jasmine</h3><p>This flower’s smell has quite a sleep punching effect. People who have tried inhaling the smell of this flower have faced a longer sleep, with fewer movements and greater sleep efficiency.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">The Scent You Love</h3><p>The rule is simple here. Choose a fragrance that can help you make sleep better. When you smell something you like, your body releases feel-good hormones that set the stage for a comfortable sleep. Once you have found the perfect fragrance, bring it into your bedroom through a candle or sleeping sprays available everywhere. Another way to add fragrance to your bedroom space is by gently mixing the fragrance in water or oil and mist your pillow and bed through that mixture.</p>'

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-3-7-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Humidity, both too much and not enough, can have an effect on your sleep. If the air is less humid then it can cause dryness and makes us hard to sleep. On the contrary, high levels of humidity can increase congestion and can also lead to allergen growth. Improving the air quality of a room by maintaining proper humidity levels, can lead to a better quality and long sleep.</p><h3 closs="intext-h3">The Right Percentage of Humidity Level</h3><p>There is no fixed or right percentage of humidity level because each environment is different. The ideal percentage, however, is 30%. If a person’s home has a 50% humidity level. A lot higher than the ideal percentage, then there are high chances of fungus growth, which can cause allergies and further have a negative impact on the sleep of the people living there. The seasons in which allergies are at peak, humidity levels below 50% are recommended to be maintained.</p><p>In excessive dryness, our respiratory system is affected the most. Our respiratory system has tiny hair called cilia, which beat and remove dust and bacteria from our system. The hair needs to be moist to do their job and, in the days, when humidity levels are really low, these hair fail to do their job. On days like these, it is appreciated to improve humidity levels by 30% to 40%.</p><h3 closs="intext-h3">When Is The Right Time To Adjust Humidity?</h3><p>A mold in a cupboard or closet signals that the surrounding environment is quite damp and humidity levels should be lowered.</p><p>If you feel that your bathroom towels remain wet all the time, then it means the air is wet and humid.</p><p>The best signal for a dry environment is when you feel your lips are all dried up and so is your throat.</p><p>Some people complain about constant dry and bloody nose. The reason behind the dryness is less humidity level in the room.</p><h3 closs="intext-h3">Tips for Humid Weather</h3><ul><li>Use cotton sheets, which are far more breathable than silk or polyester.</li><li>A dehumidifier in the room can help remove moisture in the air and give you a better sleep.</li><li>High level of humidity can cause the growth of fungus and can further cause allergies.

Nasal Strips are used to open nasal passages so one can breathe properly and have a quality sleep.</li></ul><h3 closs="intext-h3">Tips for Dry Weather</h3><p>Dry air caused by indoor heating can block the nasal passages and can also lead to congestion. Congestion leads to snoring and abnormal breathing patterns that are not good for a restful sleep. A humidifier can help remove the humidity in the room.</p><p>A walk or exercise before sleep can help keep the body moisturized with sweat and will also increase the intake of water. The increased intake of water will help moisturize the dry throat.</p><p>The tips above can vary from situation to situation. The right thing is to choose the tip that suits the environment you live in.</p><h3 closs="intext-h3">Devices Used to Control Humidity</h3><ul><li>A humidifier in winters is an appropriate device to tackle low humidity levels. You can create moisture naturally by placing a vessel of water in the room near a heater or leaving wet clothes to dry in the room. This is called Natural Evaporation. There are also portable room humidifiers available which you can set down on the floor.</li><li>A dehumidifier is usually used in summers to decrease the level of humidity.</li><li>The use of exhaust fans while cooking or taking a shower will also help in reducing moisture.</li><li>If you live in a tightly constructed home, an energy recovery ventilator will work best to kill moisture in summers.</li></ul><p>With this, let us end this chapter.

          '<p>Imagine that you are lying in bed, ready to sleep but instead of going into a deep, peaceful sleep, you start remembering your past mistakes or you start thinking about a future problem. As the hours go by, your mind keeps getting busy around these thoughts, and the plan of sleep hides away somewhere. Its times like these that knowing how to keep a journal for penning down your thoughts before bedtime comes in handy. While writing down on a journal, one should focus on positive thoughts and events only. Journaling this way helps to sleep longer and better. Sleep journaling is an amazing relaxation exercise and helps to shut down the brain before one decides to sleep.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Find Time to Write</h3><p>Journaling takes 15 minutes hardly. Taking out time for an additional activity can be hard if you are sleep deprived but the consequences are positive and have a lot of benefits. If you choose to write a journal just before bedtime every night, it can become a habit and a soothing part of a bedtime routine. If your brain is active and you are unable to sleep, then the best thing to do is to wake up and grab a notebook without turning on any bright light. You should continue writing until you feel sleepy or tired.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Write For a Better Sleep</h3><p>Journaling is a self-help strategy and is best for people with bedtime worries. Journaling before bedtime reduces stress and improve sleep quality. The journal should consist of things that happened and what were your feelings when they occurred. Also, write down all the positive outcomes of the situation that occurred. This activity will not only clear your mind before you sleep, but you will also wake up with a new and fresh thought process.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Use a Sleep Journal to Keep a Track on Your Sleep Habits</h3><p>While writing you should also spare some time to write about the time you wake up in the morning, what time you went to bed, the time you ate something before bedtime, what kind of exercise you did, your room temperature and many similar things related to your sleep. As you keep writing these stats every night, you will see a pattern forming. The pattern can help you adjust your sleep habits and also improve the timings each night.

Even if you are not one of those, reading a book before going to bed can help a lot, especially this activity can help you sleep better. Reading a book is an amazing workout for your brain. Its effects are just like how one feels good after a run or eating healthy.</p><p>Reading a book before bedtime does wonders. Even a 10-minute reading can create a great difference and impact on your mind. A daily book reading practice holds the secret to well-being and a healthy life. Here are some of the ways that tell how reading a book before bedtime can affect your health and in result contribute positively towards a good night sleep.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Reading Reduces Stress</h3><p>As discussed earlier, killing stress is quite crucial and necessary when you want a good night sleep. Reading helps to distract your mind from the various negative thoughts that might be causing you stress before bedtime.</p><p>Reading is considered a better relaxation method if compared to listening to music or drinking tea. It also helps fight against the very deadly insomnia.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Reading Is the Best Substitute for Any Kind of Screen</h3><p>Reading takes the lead when it comes to the best ritual that should be practiced before bedtime. A print book is a safer and cheap option to substitute a television or a smartphone. The worst feature of any electronic device is the bright light that they emit. This light creates disturbance and makes hard to sleep. The kind of book you are reading does not matter much. The main thing is that you should find it fully absorbing.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Food for Dreams</h3><p>Dreams are a reflection of things that happened during the day. Some people dream about characters they have read in a novel before they fell asleep. Reading a book has a great impact on your dreams and your overall sleep. It is always recommended to read a good book so that you dream well and sleep longer. People who read horror stories are usually faced by dark dreams that sometimes make them wake up in the middle of the night. So, read a book that can help you sleep longer, without any jolts.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Helps the Body to Shut Down before Bedtime</h3><p>Reading before going to bed helps the body to calm down. The calming down starts with the brain and then reaches the eyes. This prepares the body and signals the brain that it is time to close everything. If one adapts reading as a ritual, the brain will find shutting down easier as the days will pass by. The habit will then remind the brain every day that it is time to sleep.</p><p>The facts are clear here. Technology can harm but a book cannot. Find a book that suits your choices and start reading it before bedtime because that’s the perfect time one can invest in their good night sleep.</p>'

        text:
          '<img src="images/inbook/part-4-4-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>People who meditate sleep far better than those who do not. Their sleeping pattern is almost perfect, for example, if sleep was an Olympic sport then these people were surely gold medalists. Below are some of the ways in which meditation conquers sleep problems, help fight various sleep disorders and also reverse the worst cases of insomnia.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Meditation Strengthens the Brain</h3><p>People who feel fatigued and moody all the time are most sleep deficient. The production of melatonin in their brains is either suppressed or is not sufficient to help them sleep better. Meditation makes sure that the production of melatonin in the body is regulated and is smoothly produced. The production helps strengthen the functions of the brain and also assist in sleeping soundly. Meditation is also the best cure for insomnia.</p><h3 class="intext-h3">Meditation Boosts the Brainwaves of Sleep</h3><p>Those who find it hard to sleep at night, have an excess of beta brainwaves. These waves are produced when a person is in a mental state of anxiety or depression. The negative thoughts in one’s mind keep on increasing as the night pass by thus kicking up the beta waves further and further. This loop makes sure that the sleep time is delayed by a number of hours. Studies show that people who meditate have fewer beta waves and far more alpha, theta and delta brain wave patterns as compared to those who do not meditate. The waves produced through meditation are calm and are strong enough to cancel out waves that may cause insomnia. Meditation before sleep is best if you want to sleep like a baby.</p><h3>Meditation Reduces the Stress of the Past and Worries of the Future</h3><p>We have all faced the stress due to our life problems and worried about our never-ending to-do list. Both these things have caused sleep deprivation because bedtime is the perfect time to think and cry about our worries.</p><p>Meditation teaches us about mindful thought awareness. The awareness brings our brain to the present moment and helps us realize that the day is over and tomorrow is yet to come which means stressing about the past and worrying about the future is useless. This type of awareness calms down our brain and helps us sleep better.</p><p>Now that we have learned about a few of the benefits of meditation, let us continue this part by learning about the various types of meditation.</p><h3>Mindfulness Meditation</h3><p>This type of meditation involves focusing on the body and nothing else. This is the most popular and common form of meditation. During meditation, one becomes more aware of the sound of their breath or the sound of their heartbeat. This kind of meditation helps to distract you from worrying about things that might not be under your control. The focus is on being mindful without being judgmental about you.</p><h3>Concentration Meditation</h3><p>This type of meditation involves focusing on only one thing. People who do concentration meditation, choose a point of focus that helps them to relax fully and shutting other various thoughts.</p><h3>Guided Meditation</h3><p>In a guided meditation, the one who is meditating listens to the voice of his/her guide that leads them through a meditation process. The guide might ask the person to focus on particular points or also sometimes make them imagine something peaceful like a sandy beach or their favorite quiet spot. Guided meditation can be performed by taking help from a coach or there are recorded audios also available everywhere.</p><p>It does not matter what kind of meditation you practice, each type takes a few days to master. The best thing is to start meditation with 15 to 20 minutes each night and then slowly increase the duration to 30 minutes.</p>'

        text:
          '<img src="images/inbook/part-4-5-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img float-right" /><p>Two major things are linked with sleep, nutrition, and mental health. Nutrition includes eating a balanced and healthy diet, avoiding junk food as much as possible and reducing the use of caffeine and alcohol for a better sleep.</p><p>On the other hand, mental health needs to be good in order to sleep better and exercise can play a major role in maintaining a good mental state. Exercising regularly has so many health benefits. It helps boost overall blood flow in the body and keep you energized throughout the day while at night.</p><p>Exercise also helps you think better with an open mind and yes, it helps you sleep better and longer than any activity could. There is no one exercise that can improve your sleep, any type of movement or workout is better than not working at all. There are however six types of exercises that help you get a better sleep.</p><h3>1- Bodyweight Exercises</h3><p>Easy bodyweight exercises increase your body temperature and when the temperature falls, the body starts feeling calm and sleepy. This helps you to fall asleep. A regular run or a strength exercise routine, an hour before bedtime can prepare you for a good night sleep. One can start with some sit-ups and crunches that help tighten your hip muscles and also help in breathing. The idea is to do everything slowly because you do not want to increase your heart rate or blood flow just before its time to sleep.</p><h3>2- Yoga</h3><p>Any time of yoga movement is acceptable and appreciated before bedtime. The point here is to go for yoga poses that easily handled by you. Going for difficult one may only cause stress and might prove to be fatal. Maintain perfect posture with your knees, hips, and ankles and avoid doing any posture that may cause any injury.</p><h3>3- Breathing Exercises</h3><p>Deep breathing exercises prove to be most beneficial when a good posture is maintained. Inhaling and exhaling exercises are most commonly used as a warm-up before any vigorous exercise routine. Inhale for three counts, then hold for some time, and later exhale out for four. Keep the exhale longer than inhale. This exercise is most effective when the mind is stable and relaxed. Avoid these exercises when checking an email or talking to someone on the phone. We will talk about this in detail in the next part of this chapter.</p><h3>4- Visualization Exercises</h3><p>These kinds of exercises help to distract your brain. One can start by simply counting to 100 and while counting they can visualize erasing their thoughts which are quite similar to cleaning a dustbin. The main thought process behind these exercises is to slow down the mind, which is great for a wonderful sleep. Imagination plays a key role in these type of exercises. Imagining yourself in your peaceful place or with your loved ones, do help to reduce sleep and make it easy for you to sleep.</p><h3>5- Stretches</h3><p>Try doing exercises that release your most stressed muscles and joints. These types of stretches are best for a good sleep. Stretching hips and back before going to sleep are very important. Butterfly stretches are also quite beneficial for a good night sleep.</p><h3>6- Meditation</h3><p>This has been discussed in the previous part and we will not explain it all over again here. Meditation is as important as any other type of exercise. I will just add here one thing. Some men find themselves too macho for meditation. This feeling can be overcome by meditating with a partner. Two people meditating together can help set a routine.</p><h3>7-Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h3><p>This exercise makes your muscles to relax after tightening them for some time. You need to start this exercise by first finding a comfortable place to lie on. Lie on your back and breathe through your nose. Start with tightening your toe muscles. Tense the muscles and hold the tension for 10 seconds. Once 10 seconds have passed, release the tension and relax. Perform the same exercise with other parts of the body such as hands, shoulders, knees, and feet.</p><p>The feeling of relaxation after this exercise will make you sleep better. You will find an urge in yourself to sleep and relax. If, for some reason you fail to feel relax, perform the exercise one more time.</p><p>There is no set rule or no fixed setup that you need to have before starting an exercise but make sure that the atmosphere around you is exercise appropriate. For instance, those who need to meditate should make sure that the light in their surroundings is as low as possible but those who are into stretching or cardio can put up loud music. The choice is entirely yours.</p>'

          "<p>Breathing is a perfect practice that can help you to sleep better. Sleeping and breathing have a wonderful relation. Your breathing practices can help you relax and make you feel stress-free.</p><p>Breathing through the mouth is considered harmful and it always advised to breathe through your nose. When you inhale air through your nose, the air gets properly warm and moisture before it gets to your lungs. The tiny hairs on your nose help to filter out dust from reaching in with the air you inhale. When you breathe through your mouth, only dry and unfiltered air gets in your body, which brings lots of bacteria with it.</p><p>Breathing through nose increases circulation of air to the lungs and also the overall capacity of the lungs. Mouth breathing does none of that which is why it is not recommended.</p><p>Breathing through mouth leads to a lack of oxygen in the body because the regulation of oxygen and carbon dioxide isn’t performed effectively. The lack of oxygen can lead to difficulty in breathing and usually wake us up at night.</p><p>Breathing and sleeping go hand in hand. You need to take care of your breathing so that you can get enough sleep. Control Pause is a simple test that can measure your relative breathing volume.</p><h3>Control Pause</h3><p>This is a breath hold test that measures the extent of your breathing volume. It is helpful in providing you the symptoms and also your progress on the amount of time you can hold your breath. The five steps of this test are:</p><ol><li>Take a small breath in and then a small breath out.</li><li>Hold your nose with your fingers tightly.</li><li>Count the seconds you can stably block your nose.</li><li>Your inhalation at the end of the breath-hold should be no greater than breathing prior to taking the measurement.</li><li>Release your nose and inhale in.</li></ol><h3>What does Control Pause mean?</h3><p>The lower your breathe hold, the greater is your breathing volume and the greater are your symptoms of anxiety.

The brain’s default mode is usually related to thinking about our past, worrying about the problems of the future and bothering ourselves into thinking how and why other people perceive or judge us. This mindset occurs more than we can expect and usually acts as a barrier between us and a good night sleep. The consistent occurrence of this mindset can lead to insomnia in just a few days. To fight against this thought process or pattern, cognitive behavioral therapy was developed as its treatment. We will learn about this therapy in the next part of this chapter but to give you a small idea, this therapy involves in replacing the negative thoughts with the positive ones.</p>'

          "<p>This therapy requires you to understand your thoughts and various feelings that can affect your behavior. This therapy is used to treat various disorders like phobias, anxiety, and depression to count a few. The treatment is short-term and deals with identifying negative or evil thoughts that have a negative impact on one’s attitude and behavior.</p><h3>Basics</h3><p>Our feelings and thoughts play a major role in influencing our thought process that then affects our behavior and attitude towards things and people. People, who are always thinking of plane crashes, might find it hard to relax on a plane if they are made to travel by air. The purpose of this therapy is to guide people that although, they cannot have a control over the world, life or death; they can, however, have a control on the way they think about something, their perspectives, and vision. CBT has become quite common and popular in the recent times because it is short-term and far cheaper than any similar kind of therapy.</p><h3>Fight against Negativity</h3><p>With CBT, people are asked to analyze their negative thoughts and are made to look in the reality to find any pieces of evidence that might support or refute these thoughts. Through this process, people take a more realistic and practical look at these thoughts which might be causing them depression or anxiety. Once they have realized that the negative thoughts are unrealistic, they then find themselves being engaged in a healthier and positive thinking pattern.</p><h3>The Process</h3><p>The assigned therapist plays a very important role throughout this therapy. The whole treatment is highly focused and goal oriented which is why the client and the therapist are expected to work as a team. The client is usually explained about the whole therapy in detail and is also given various tasks to complete at home between each session.</p><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is a very effective treatment for various psychological problems. The results produced by this treatment can be measured quite easily and since it is goal oriented, it is highly researched and applied around the world.</p>"

Keeping a good company and spending time with people who think only good about us, can play a major role in how well we sleep at night. People who have a really positive relationship and bond with their spouses or partners usually have an efficient sleep. Both the genders are affected in the same way. On the other hand, a general security in relationships leads to a disturbed sleep pattern.</p><p>People, who tend to spend more time with their loved ones sleep well than the people who keep themselves isolated with their closed ones. This is particularly effective for teens and elderly people because people in these two categories are usually faced with isolation due to their age as well as a changed mindset. Teens and elderly people need someone to talk to so that they can share their thought process with them. Sharing a thing that might be bothering us can help remove all the waste from our minds, make everything clear and help us to sleep better.</p><h3>How to Choose a Good Company?</h3><p>Some people might find it hard to look for people who are encouraging and helping. A good company is anyone who thinks good about you, helps you when it is needed and always gives an advice that might prove to be the best one for you. Finding a good company might be hard but not impossible. Look for groups of people who have a positive attitude towards life and they look for everything good rather than focusing on things that might be bad or negative.</p><h3>Advice for Parents of Teenagers</h3><p>People in their teenage might involve themselves in the company of the wrong people who might influence them in the most negative way possible. In such cases, the role of parents is vital.</p><p>The parents of teenagers should be able to talk to their teens about their lives, studies and people they hang out with. Only a good and fruitful conversation can help both the parties to resolve various issues that their kids might be facing. And if their teen is sleeping well, then obviously the parents can relax and sleep soundly.</p><h3>Advice for Elderly People</h3><p>Elderly people are usually faced with small or no company at all. This is one of the reasons that they feel lonely and depressed which make it hard for them to sleep at night. Elderly people can find the good company through social media. If you are one who belongs to this group, you can join various pages and groups on social media websites that keep you busy and entertained for long. You can also befriend many people that share a mindset similar to yours. There are also various clubs and cafes that elderly people can join or visit to keep their minds busy. Various golf courses are available everywhere and they are the best places to meet people from various walks of life.</p><p>With this, we will end this chapter. We hope this chapter has helped you a great deal when it comes to little things that can influence your sleep and create a larger than life impact over your lifestyle. In the next chapter, we will look at something equally important and that is our food and how it plays a role in making us sleep better.</p>"

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-5-2-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beginning" /><p>Let us talk about these two separately.</p><h3>Sugar and sleep</h3><p>Who doesn’t like having a spoon or two of something sweet after every dinner? Well, the answer is many of us but do you realize how foods high in sugar can have a negative effect on our sleep. Various studies have concluded that people who consume a lot of sugar during the day are usually faced with sleepless nights or usually find themselves waking up several times at night.</p><p>An increased consumption of sugar throughout the day can cause a crash in energy. Some people feel drowsy and lazy after consuming a brownie in the afternoon. Well, the reason is that too much consumption of sugar reduces the activity of orexin cells in the body. The fall in their activity then leads to drowsy feelings.</p><p>The purpose here is to keep the blood sugar levels as steady as possible. A regulated blood sugar level can help keep the energy levels balances during the day and then at night, you will feel enough tired and drowsy to sleep properly.</p><p>Refined sugar is the main culprit here and should be avoided at all times. It is found in soda, sauces, cereals, juices, and desserts. It is also present in your bead, rice, pasta and many other food items. It is about time that you reduce or cut back on these foods and consume foods with complex carbohydrates and high nutritional value. This will not only make you feel energized but will also help you sleep better.</p><h3>Caffeine and sleep</h3><p>Caffeine contributes greatly when it comes to a disruptive sleep. Caffeine delays the timing of the body clock which makes it hard to sleep on time. It also reduces the duration of deep sleep one can enjoy. Caffeine consumption in the late afternoon or early hours of the evening can affect the sleep the most. Consuming caffeine 6 hours before bedtime can reduce the total sleep one can have by one hour. This is because can stay in the bloodstream for a maximum of six hours. This is the reason why every health guidelines suggest limiting the consumption of caffeine in the late afternoon and evening hours. People who have aged a lot might find their bodies take a longer time to process the caffeine they consumed.</p><p>Caffeine makes us feel active and alert. This is because it regulates the production of adrenaline in our body and blocks the production of chemicals that helps one sleep. If consumed in a high dose, caffeine can cause diarrhea, nausea, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate and palpitations. All these problems can lead to a great disruption in sleep.</p><p>Both of the above types of food are harmful and can lead to various problems if consumed at high levels. One goal that every single person should achieve from now on is to start decreasing the consumption of these two, gradually until you find it safe and healthy to completely remove them from your diet.</p>'

Foods that are high in fat and spices can have a great impact on your quality of sleep. Although fast food or junk food is the most convenient and delicious kind of food in every way, it only harms our waistline and also our sleep habits and patterns.</p><h3>Junk Food and sleep</h3><p>Junk food affects our sleep in many dangerous ways. Junk food is high in sugar, fat, and spices. People who are extreme fast-food lovers have been either obese or are usually faced with heart problems. Here are some of the ways that junk food can contribute towards sleep deficiency.</p><ul><li>Obesity: The increased consumption of fast food has a great impact on the high obesity levels around the world. There is no doubt that obesity comes with various health issues and also affects the mental health of an individual. Obesity causes various heart issues, sleep apnea, dubieties, cancer, and whatnot. All these diseases connect to a sleep deficiency.</li><li>Heartburn: Junk food is always related to being greasy because the amount of oil used to prepare it is far more than we use at homes. Heartburn is the result of the backflow of food particles and acids released by the stomach into the esophagus. This backflow is not normal and anything that’s not normal only harms. Heartburn creates a restless sleep and people usually find themselves waking up at odd intervals each night.</li><li>Depression: This is an undeniable fact that the consumption of fast food can lead to depression. People who eat junk food are 51% more likely to get depressed if compared to the people who have little or no junk food as part of their diets. Depression can create stress, anxiety, and negativity in one’s mind. All of these factors can then further affect the ability to fall asleep.</li></ul><p>Now believe it or not some fast food options aren’t as bad. Many restaurants offer healthier fast foods and all you have to do is ask them. There are little changes one makes in their order to convert their junk food into a little healthier food.</p><ul><li>Whole grain buns or bread are commonly offered by many restaurants. They keep your tummy full for a longer period and also increase the serotonin level in the body which makes one have a good sleep.</li><li>Grilled food: Choosing a grilled burger patty over a fried patty is one way you can give your junk food a healthy touch. Any kind of grilled food is less greasy, has fewer calories and also reduces the chances of having an upset stomach.</li><li>Salads: Ordering salads as opposed to fries as your sides, is the biggest step you take to create a good change for yourself. Salads are also far fulfilling than fries.</li><li>Say no to cheese: Cheese can be avoided quite easily. Replace cheese with sauces and vegetables like cabbage, tomatoes, and cucumber.</li><li>Spices: Every restraint now asks about one need their spices. Always go for mild food with spice level as normal as possible. Too hot food can cause indigestion and heartburn which results in an uncomfortable state.</li></ul><p>By making these few, simple changes to your junk food; you are not only choosing to eat healthy but downright are preparing your body for a better sleep at night.</p>'

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-5-4-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img float-right" /><p>Minimizing the intake of salt can bring major changes to your health. Too much salt in your diet can cause heart problems and obesity and it can also be one of the reasons why you find hard sleeping at night. The excess salt in your diet can also be one of the reasons that can cause you to stress about things and also why you get angry on small issues. It can also cause severe depression and well, as discussed before, depression is one of the major reasons why people fall into a sleep deficiency. This is an undeniable fact, that salt is necessary for our health and an essential mineral for our body to function properly. A balanced amount of salt, as opposed to excessive salt, can help shape up our lives and keep us healthy and happy. </p><h3>Positive Results from Having a Balanced Amount of Salt </h3><p>A natural and balanced amount of salt has various advantages. It is good for strengthening our muscles, boosts our nervous system and is essential for the health of our heart. The right amount of salt in your food can save one from being dehydrated. However, without any doubt, an excessive amount of salt can have various negative effects on one’s health and can, therefore, contribute in sleepless night.</p><h3>Negative Contribution of Salt to Our Diet</h3><p>Too much amount of salt in our food can lead to high blood pressure or sometimes called hypertension. An excess amount of salt increases the blood volume and also lead to the retention of water in the body. All this affects the circulation of blood in the body, which affects the ability to sleep.</p><p>High level of salt intake can also affect your mental state. People who consume excess salt are usually hot-tempered, victims of anxiety and depression. They lose their ability to think practically at the times when it is needed. Increasing in the blood’s pressure in the body is one of the reasons; these people go through such mental state.</p><h3>Water Retention Is Harmful</h3><p>An excess amount of water in your body can make it hard for you to sleep. The feeling is uncomfortable when you lie down on the bed to sleep. The retained water, at times, is settled on the upper part of the body thus making it hard for the person to breathe properly. It can also lead to sleep apnea, which is one of the most common sleeping disorders. Water retention is harmful and can cause various heart problems as well. It is very important to reduce the amount of salt in one’s food in order to reverse the negative effects caused by the water retention.</p><h3>Make a Change and Reduce the Quantity of Salt in Your Diet</h3><p>The biggest sources of excess salt are the junk food and processed food. These two are the most convenient forms of food and hence their consumption is more than any food that is freshly cooked.</p><p>One of the most efficient ways of reducing salt intake is by cooking food freshly, from the start. This is the only way that one can achieve a balanced amount of salt in their food and they can also keep a check on the type of food they are consuming. For your own health, this is not a sacrifice but a chance to feel better, stay healthy and sleep soundly.</p>'

The various chemicals that you inhale while smoking is to be blamed for causing such huge destruction in a human body.</p><p>Nicotine, especially, is linked with causing disruptive sleep. This particular substance is also the reason why people get addicted to smoking. Smoking consistently, every single day can affect your body’s sleep routine and some of the damage caused is so huge that it is hard to be undone.</p><p>Below is the list of ways that explain how smoking can prove to be harmful to your sleep routine.</p><h3>It Affects the Natural Circadian Rhythm of the Body</h3><p>It has been researched and concluded that smoking a large amount of tobacco can harm the internal clock of the body, thus affecting the functions of both the brain and the lungs. Such disruption ruins a peaceful night’s sleep. The effect on the internal clock only worsens as the consumption of tobacco increases over the time. The consequences of such damage are beyond a restless sleep as it can also lead to depression, mood swings, and various mental disorders.</p><h3>Smoking Can Cause Sleep Apnea</h3><p>People who smoke are 2.5 times more likely to suffer from the deadly sleep apnea as compared to people who do not smoke. Smoking can cause the most common type of sleep apnea in which the muscles at the back of the throat collapse while one is asleep. Smokers commonly face the harmful effects of sleep apnea because the smoke inhaled ends up irritating the tissues in the nose and the throat that creates a hindrance for a normal flow of air.</p><h3>Smokers Usually Wake Up at Intervals Every Night</h3><p>People who smoke experience a restless sleep as compared to people who do not. There sleep is light and full of interferences while the non-smokers experience a restorative and deep sleep.</p><h3>Smokers Usually Wake Up Tired and Restless</h3><p>Nicotine is just like caffeine. It is both a drug and also a stimulant. It has a great effect on a person’s sleep if consumed in high quantity and just a few hours before bedtime. A smoker loses 1.2 minutes of sleep for every time they smoke. It is suggested to avoid smoking within two hours of bedtime because of the disruption nicotine can cause to the natural wake/sleep cycle of the body.</p><h3>Smokers Can Suffer From Insomnia</h3><p>Nicotine is a potent stimulant and can contribute to causing insomnia. Women in their late midlife are at a higher risk of suffering from insomnia provided they smoke regularly and close to bedtime.</p><p>It is an undeniable fact that smoking can harm a person more than it can give them pleasure. It is never too late to change your smoking habits for a good health and sound sleep.</p><h3>Alcohol and Sleep</h3><p>Drinking alcohol is often associated with sleep. People all around the world consume alcohol to help them fall asleep. Although it is a depressant and can help one sleep faster, alcohol can cause a disruptive sleep if consumed every day in high volumes. There are many ways in which alcohol can prove to be destructive for your mind and body. Some of these are discussed below.</p><h3>Alcohol Causes Disruption to the Body’s Sleep Waves</h3><p>Alcohol consumption not only generates delta activity but also starts an alpha activity in the body. Delta waves help one fall into a deep sleep that is essential for memory formation and learning. Alpha activity does not really occur when one is sleeping. It is an activity that allows one to just rest quietly. These two together can affect the sleep negatively and may affect the restoration of sleep.</p><h3>It interferes With the Body’s Circadian Rhythms</h3><p>Although alcohol makes you fall asleep quickly at night, it also has the tendency to wake you up in the middle of the night. Alcohol affects the normal production of chemicals in the body that affects your sleep patterns. The production of adenosine in the body increases after you consume alcohol at night, which then results in you to sleep faster. However, the adenosine production falls down as quickly as it started which results in waking you up way before you feel fresh and properly rested.</p><h3>Alcohol Causes Breathing Problems</h3><p>Alcohol causes the whole body to relax including the throat muscles. This can make you hard to breathe while sleeping and can cause sleep apnea.</p><p>Both alcohol and smoke can prove to be quite harmful and the best way to get rid of these two is to start from today and gradually decrease the consumption of these two harmful things.</p>'

A non-fat yogurt can be consumed if you do not fancy a high-calorie food at night. Some of the reasons as to why and how yogurt can prove to be beneficial for you are listed below.</p><h3>Yogurt Induces Sleep</h3><p>Yogurt contains amino acids such as tryptophan. These acids help produce sleep-inducing chemicals called melatonin. Yogurt helps to promote these chemicals that play a role in calming down the brain which further assists you in sleeping well during the night.</p><p>Yogurt can prove to be quite beneficial for the people who suffer from insomnia. These people should consume it regularly before bedtime and note the changes that have occurred in their sleep patterns.</p><h3>It Is Best For the People Who Are Lactose-Intolerant</h3><p>Warm milk, just as yogurt is also one of the best things to consume before bedtime. Like yogurt, it also contains tryptophan, which is good for sleep. However, people who are lactose-intolerant are not allowed to consume milk. However, they can consume yogurt because it has a reduced amount of lactose.</p><h3>Yogurt Helps To Digest Food</h3><p>A good digestive system is a sign of good health. Most of the health issues you face are lined with the health of the stomach so it is very important to keep it healthy and running at all times.

It is rich in protein and having a bowl of yogurt before bedtime can help prevent muscle loss.</p><h3>Ways to Eat Yogurt before Bedtime</h3><p>You should opt for plain yogurt before bedtime. Yogurt that is high in sugar can increase the blood sugar levels and can make it hard for you to sleep at night. You can add berries or dried fruit to their bowl of yogurt to give it a more interesting flavor.</p><p>The use of flax seeds in a bowl of yogurt is also quite a healthy option. Some people consider having a toast with yogurt. For a healthy snack, choose a toast of whole wheat bread. Oatmeal and yogurt also go best together. Having them in a single bowl also increases the overall nutrition you are consuming before bedtime.</p><p>Greek yogurt can also be consumed at night. It is made from sheep’s milk and comes in both low- fat and full-fat varieties. Frozen yogurt should be avoided before bedtime because it usually contains artificial flavorings and sugar.</p><p>Although eating yogurt is beneficial before bedtime but you should take care of their serving size. A large serving of yogurt can increase the calorie intake and can also make you feel heavy before bedtime.</p>'

All these supplements are regarded as a part of many natural remedies for sleep.</p><h3>Melatonin</h3><p>Melatonin, as discussed previously, is a hormone produced by the body that helps control the sleep and wake cycle. Its production is highly affected by light exposure and its level is high at night. It is a hormone of darkness. Melatonin is found in small quantities in meat, fruits, and vegetables. It is also used as a supplement to treat jet lag and insomnia but these supplements are prohibited in many countries. It is always advised to consume melatonin through natural food items. Supplements containing melatonin can cause various side effects that some bodies might not be able to bear.</p><h3>Vitamin D</h3><div>The deficiency of vitamin D is associated with less sleep and insomnia. This vitamin is called “the sunshine vitamin”. It influences both the quantity and quality of sleep you are having. Sun is the biggest source of Vitamin D. Other sources include oily fish and egg yolks.</div><h3>Iron</h3><p>There is a range of food that is rich in iron. Iron tablets are also available to boost the production of iron in your body. Lack of iron can cause restless leg syndrome in which people feel that they constantly need to move their legs when they go to their beds. This condition can make it hard for the sufferer to sleep or even take a nap. Women are usually found to be more iron-deficient as compared to men and they are more likely to suffer from a lack of sleep. Food rich in iron includes lamb, beef, beans, chocolate and various green vegetables.</p><h3>Calcium</h3><p>In the previous chapters, we learned how the amino acid tryptophan is used and is essential in the production of melatonin in the body. Calcium is one of the supplements that help the brain to use tryptophan. Calcium is also necessary for the strengthening of bones and muscles. In the chapter where we discussed various foods, milk consumption before bedtime was mentioned as an effective to sleep better. Milk is rich in calcium and this is what explains its quality to help you sleep better.</p><h3>Magnesium</h3><p>Magnesium consumption helps one tackle stress and anxiety and in result helps you sleep better. Foods rich in magnesium include vegetables, nuts, fish and whole grains.</p><h3>L-Theanine</h3><p>This compound is found in green tea and it does quite an effective job. It has a calming effect on the brain. Its quality to absorb quickly in the blood helps it to reach the brain and enhance the levels of amino acids in the body makes it quite useful to consume. L-theanine is available in single formula tablets and capsules and is also present with other nutrients. L-theanine is not a sedative, as many people think of it.</p><h3>5-HTP</h3><p>5-HTP stands for 5-hydroxy-tryptophan. This is made by the body from tryptophan. It assists in making serotonin. This supplement is mostly used to treat depression and insomnia.</p>'

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-6-3-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img float-right" /><p>Medication of any kind can prove to be fatal if consumed without any need or without any assistance from an expert. Although prescription pills work quite fast and are usually effective when taken in, they can harm your body and can result in several disorders that can cause further health issues.</p><p>Below, we have listed 12 disadvantages of consuming a sleeping pill just for the sake of a good night sleep.</p><ol><li>Sleep medications can cause addiction. Many people are accidentally addicted towards these medications if consumed for more than a week. This is one of the reasons why doctors recommend a minimum dose only if no other natural remedy is proving to be effective.</li><li>People who use sleeping pills for longer than a week are faced with the need for a higher dose of medication with every passing night. Longer use of these pills can lead to an ineffective relief from insomnia. The body becomes used to consuming pills and then sleeping but for some reason, if you are unable to take one at night, the feeling of sleepless only becomes painful.</li><li>This is a just a myth that sleeping pills help to improve the quality of your sleep. People usually get less satisfying sleep by consuming a pill before bedtime. They usually get five or six hours of a decent, deep sleep and that is obviously not enough.</li><li>Discontinuing the usage of a sleeping pill can lead to various bigger issues such as anxiety, agitation, and insomnia. These issues can create a damage that is worse than the damage any other pill can cause</li><li>Consumption of sleeping pills can cause a decline in the overall physical health of an individual. Research shows that women, who consume sleep pills for a longer time and in high quantities, are faced with a declined and poor physical health in their early adult years. The women who do not take sleeping pills are more healthy and fit as compared to those who do.</li><li>People who consume other medications are requested not to take any sleeping pills as they can interact negatively with each other. It goes for people who consume alcohol on a daily basis.</li><li>Sleeping pills can contribute to causing breast cancer and kidney and liver diseases in people. Those women who are pregnant or breastfeed their babies are disallowed to consume sleeping pills as they can also prove to be harmful to the baby. Women with respiratory problems, sleep apnea or depression are at a higher risk of worsening their health by consuming any type of sleep medication.</li><li>Unlike homeopathic or natural remedies, sleep medications come with various side effects. Some of the side effects include dizziness, memory shortage, daytime drowsiness, headaches, suicidal feelings and various allergies.</li><li>Sleeping pills can cause skin cancer and when the dosage is increased, the chances of catching cancer also increases with time.</li><li>Using sleeping pills regularly increases the dependency of a person on them. Dependency on anything is wrong even if it is a pill that can help you sleep faster.</li><li>Pills only tackle the sleeplessness but do not identify the real cause of sleep deficiency you are going through. The underlying reasons for sleepless nights can be depression or anxiety. These things are not looked for when doctors prescribe a sleeping pill.</li><li>Lastly, various people consume sleeping pills to not exactly fall asleep but to divert their minds from various worries and grieves. This is when this becomes most harmful as people assume taking pills is an easy way to stay away from the world’s issues and problems. Rather than manning up and facing them, they pop in a pill and forget all their worries.</li></ol><p>If you belong to the group of people who consume sleeping pills, make an effort to quit it but quit gradually and not suddenly. Reduce your dosage slowly. Quitting suddenly can harm your body. While you are in a quitting phase, start making changes in your sleeping habits. These changes are mentioned in the book such as avoid light before bedtime, use an appropriate pillow to rest your head on, avoid eating junk food before bedtime, listen to a soothing noise at night and do a light exercise before you decide to sleep.</p><p>All these changes will create a difference and will make easy for you to survive through this quitting phase.</p>'

They have to wake up after every three to four hours to feed their babies. Breastfeeding is a tough job but through our tips, we can guide you in various ways by which you can get enough sleep.</p><h3>Breastfeed While Being In a Comfortable Position</h3><p>A good position for breastfeeding is essential. Lying down while breastfeeding, although won’t contribute in sleeping, it will get you some rest if you are horizontal. Choose a position that won’t cause any back pain which can further create problems for your sleep after you are done with feeding your baby.</p><h3>Stay Close To Your Baby</h3><p>Breastfeeding mothers who keep their babies close to them at night are more likely to get a better sleep and are usually more positive about continuing breastfeeding for a longer period with ease. Bed sharing is the one option that can help keep the baby close to you. Mothers who are non-smokers and do not consume any drugs or medications can opt for this option. Make sure that your mattress and bed coverings are baby friendly.</p><h3>Turn Off the Lights</h3><p>Keep the lights off when the baby demands to be nursed. Switching on the light will only make them active. A dark environment will also make it easy for the mother to catch up on the lost sleep, faster. A flashlight or nightlight might be used to have a look on baby’s latching.</p><h3>Keep the Clock Away</h3><p>Mothers who prefer checking the time while breastfeeding might end up feeling depressed after seeing the amount of sleep they have had. The best thing is to hide the clock somewhere as prevention from being affected by such a depression.</p><h3>Put Everything Necessary within Your Reach</h3><p>Like keeping your baby close to you, keep all his necessities within your reach. Keep diapers, water or some light snack close to avoid wastage of time and energy.</p><h3>Consume a Calcium/ Magnesium Supplement</h3><p>A calcium and magnesium supplement taken before bedtime can help one sleep better.</p><h3>Hot Milk</h3><p>Hot milk before bedtime assists in relaxing your body before bedtime. Milk from cow or goat can prove to be quite effective.</p><h3>Nap</h3><p>This is the most important tip. Napping with the baby can make a huge difference and will prevent you from suffering from any kind of sleep deficiency.</p><p>As the baby grows, his milk demands start changing and will be less crucial at night. Until then, keep taking help from these tips to help you sleep better at night.</p>'

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-7-2-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img float-right" /><p>A good sleep is very important for older adults because it helps to improve the memory formation and also repairs any cell that would have been damaged during the day. It cleans one’s immune system that later helps in preventing various diseases. Older adults who fail to get enough sleep usually suffer from depression, attention and various other diseases such as memory loss. Older women also risk their lives by having breast cancer because of sleepless nights.</p><p>Most adults are required to sleep for at least 7 hours every night. People, who frequently wake up at night or are tired during the day, are usually faced with sleep deficiency. Below are some simple procedures or methods that you can practice to analyze your sleep patterns and then improve them accordingly.</p><h3>Understand the Change in Sleep with Age</h3><p>As people age, their bodies produce less amount of growth hormones that results in a decrease in sleep waves or a deep sleep at night. This leads to a low production of melatonin in the body. The low levels reduce the amount of sleep one experiences at night. Older people usually start feeling sleepy in the earlier hours of an evening and then usually end up waking at night.</p><p>This change in sleep should be understood and analyzed so that a better sleep pattern is formed. Those people who start feeling sleepy before night can indulge themselves in various activities in the evening such as reading or some sort of exercise. This will not only help in extending their sleep time but will also help to sleep better and soundly at night.</p><h3>Improve Sleep Patterns by Bringing a Positive Change in Your Sleep Habits</h3><p>Sleep habits play a great role in maintaining a good night sleep. By having consistent sleep schedules, for example, sleeping and waking at fixed timings each day, will not only improve the standard of sleep but will also make you feel energized during the day.</p><p>Older adults can develop soothing bedtime rituals to sleep better. A hot shower before bedtime or warm milk just an hour before sleep time can make a lot of difference.</p><p>Older people usually fall for sleep pills to enhance their sleep. Sleep aids or pills can only prove to be harmful. They have various side effects and at an age in which the body is weak, the side effects can prove to be quite fatal.</p><h3>Napping Is Great</h3><p>A short nap during the day is perfect for the people of any age group. Keep the nap short; 15 to 30-minute nap is more than enough. One should prefer napping in the early hours of the evening, not closer to bedtime. The tips to a perfect nap have been discussed in detail in Part number 2.</p>'

Shift workers usually sleep in the day hours so it is important to sleep in a room that is dark and far away from any kind of noise pollution.</p><h3>After Work, Choose Bed before Anything Else</h3><p>Night shifters should prefer sleeping as soon as they go to their homes after work. The more they get involved in various other activities such as television or surfing the internet, the harder it will become for them to sleep.

Night shifters can choose to wear sunglasses on their way back to avoid the daylight.</p><h3>Reduce Caffeine Consumption at Work</h3><p>Night shifters usually consume lots of caffeine in order to keep them awake.

          '<img src="images/inbook/part-7-4-image-1.jpg" class="intext-img at-beggining" /><p>There is no doubt that traveling is very essential for both the mind and the body. Those who travel a lot are also aware of the pre-dawn wake-up calls, jet lags, adjusting to a new environment in a hotel and many more changes that they face when they are in a new country or city that they traveled to.</p><p>Some people fall asleep right after the plane takes off while there are many people who do not close their eyes at all while being on a plane.</p><p>Changes in time zones also play a great role in creating a disruption in the night sleep. In this part of the book, we will look at various ways we can get a good sleep despite being in a plane or at a hotel that is different from the usual sleep environment.</p><h3>While On the Plane, Choose a Window Seat, If Possible</h3><p>A window seat is a good option since it provides a support to lean on when you want to sleep while being in the air. Sitting with the window also gives an impression of vastness for those people who find planes congested.</p><h3>Avoid Seats near The Bathroom or the Kitchen Area</h3><p>The bathroom and the kitchen area of the plane are usually busy with the noise of people and smells. Both could be bad or good but either of them is not good for you if you want to sleep. The exit seats do give a lot of legroom but they do not recline hence they are not good for sleep.</p><h3>Keep Your Eye Masks and Ear Plugs On-Hand</h3><p>Eye masks and earplugs can be great for blocking out unwanted distraction in the plane. A relaxation video can also help you to sleep better.</p><h3>Avoid Alcohol While Traveling on a Plane</h3><p>It is a known fact that one drink in the air is equal to two while being on the ground. This is because of the air pressure in the cabin. Some people prefer mixing their sleeping pill with a glass of wine. Do not do that. It can make you feel disoriented and might prove to be dangerous.</p><h3>Switch Off Your Monitor Screen</h3><p>By switching off your monitor screen, you save yourself from the exposure to blue light. As discussed previously, blue light blocks sleep and make it harder for you to feel drowsy.</p><p>You can also make small changes, while being in your hotel room, to fall asleep quickly.</p><h3>Create a Comfortable Atmosphere</h3><p>You can play the music of your choice that can help you sleep better. You can also buy candles from the local shops to give yourself a soothing effect.</p><h3>Take Help from the Hotel Administration</h3><p>You can always call up the hotel administration and ask for a coziest and quietest room, if possible. This should be done while you are planning your trip.</p><h3>Bring Your Own Pillow</h3><p>Many people find it tough to sleep on a new pillow. Bringing your own pillow will not only provide you with comfort but also help in sleeping better.</p><p>Travelling can be very tiring especially if it is a long flight.
